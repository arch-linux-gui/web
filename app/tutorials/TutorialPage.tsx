    title: "Verify your Arch Linux GUI Download",
    description: `In this video, we take a look at how to verify that you have downloaded exactly what I uploaded using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). The Secure Hash Algorithms are a family of cryptographic hash functions. A cryptographic hash is like a signature for a data set. If you would like to compare two sets of raw data (source of the file, text or similar) it is always better to hash it and compare SHA256 values. This is why I provide the SHA256 checksums in a file named sha256sum.txt. This makes it suitable for checking integrity of your download. 
    In this video, I will show you how to get a SHA256 checksum and compare with the strings I have provided, to ensure the legitimacy of the download. I will cover how you can do this on Windows and Linux. I have explained on Windows 11, however, the steps are applicable to Windows 10 and Windows 7. Simillarly, the steps show for Linux are done on Arch, but can be done on any Linux Distribution. You can find the checksums here as well.`,

    In this video we use the ALG Minimal ISO. The automatic installation, can be performed with the help of all 10 ALG ISOs, for both the UEFI/GPT setup, as well as BIOS/MBR setup.`,

    Software in the AUR is not compiled, most of the time and has to be done locally. In this video we discuss two methods:
    1. Manual Method with makepkg (paru is the example)
    2. With help of an AUR helper (that was just installed in the step above), and pamac-all is the example.
    Alternate title to this video can also be How to install Pamac. The reason pamac is not included in the ALG ISOs is because pamac is Manjaro's project. It has nothing to do with Arch directly, apart from the fact the many people actually like it.`,
